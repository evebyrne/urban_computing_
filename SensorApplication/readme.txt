To run 

Use Android Studio to load the app onto a phone.
Unfortunately I was not able to get the virtual SD card working on an emulator/Android Virtual Device so it has to be run on an actual phone. 
CLick on button 'Get sound level data'.
Click start to start recording sound amplitude data and send it to a csv file.
CLick stop to stop recording the data and return to the home screen.
The resulting csv file can be found in internal storage.
